Created a Java application named "ReverseStrings" that performs the following tasks:

    Prompt the user for a 3-character string and validate its length. If invalid, display an error message and exit.
    Prompt the user for a 4-character string and validate its length. If invalid, display an error message and exit.
    Print both input strings separated by a space.
    Print the two input strings in reverse order, with the second string reversed first, also separated by a space.

Constraints:

    The program must not use loops or StringBuilder.
    Ensure proper command line prompts and formatted output.
    If either input is invalid, output "Invalid string length for one or both inputs." and halt further processing.

Example Output: If the user enters 'use' and 'this', the output should be:
